# Password Manager

## Description

This project is a **desktop password manager application** built using **C# and WinForms**.  
The purpose of the application is to allow users to store, manage, and retrieve their passwords securely in a local environment.

The motivation behind this project was to build a complete application from scratch that combines user interface design, database management, and basic security concepts. Instead of focusing only on finishing a project quickly, I wanted to understand how different parts of an application communicate with each other and how design decisions affect usability and security.

This project was developed as my **CS50 Final Project**.



## Application Overview

The password manager allows the user to:

- Add new passwords by providing a website, username, and password
- Store passwords in a local SQLite database
- Automatically encrypt passwords before saving them
- Display saved passwords in a table with passwords hidden by default
- Reveal a password only when the user explicitly requests it
- Delete existing passwords
- Automatically create the database if it does not exist

The application is intentionally kept offline and local to avoid unnecessary complexity and security risks related to networking.



## Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **WinForms** for the graphical user interface
- **SQLite** for local database storage
- **AES encryption** for securing stored passwords
- **Visual Studio** for development



## File Structure and Explanation

### `Program.cs`
This is the entry point of the application. It initializes the WinForms application and opens the main form. This file follows the standard structure generated by Visual Studio for WinForms projects.

### `MainForm.cs` (or equivalent form file)
This file contains the main user interface logic. It handles:
- Button click events (add, delete, show password)
- Interaction with the `DataBaseManager`
- Displaying data in the `DataGridView`
- Validating user input
- Masking passwords in the table with `******`

The UI logic is kept separate from database and encryption logic to improve readability and maintainability.

### `DataBaseManager.cs`
This class is responsible for **all database-related operations**. It:
- Builds a dynamic file path for the database so the app works on any computer
- Automatically creates the database and tables if they do not exist
- Opens and manages SQLite connections
- Executes SQL queries such as inserting, selecting, and deleting passwords
- Retrieves encrypted passwords by ID when needed

Separating database logic into its own class follows good design practices and makes the application easier to extend.

### `EncryptionHelper.cs`
This class contains static methods for encrypting and decrypting passwords using **AES**.  
Passwords are encrypted before being saved to the database and decrypted only when the user clicks the “Show Password” button.

The encryption key and IV are currently hardcoded for learning purposes. This limitation is acknowledged and discussed in the Future Improvements section.



## Database Design

The application uses a local SQLite database with the following table:
```
Passwords
- Id (INTEGER, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
- Website (TEXT)
- Username (TEXT)
- PasswordEncrypted (TEXT)
- DateAdded (TEXT)
```

The database file is stored locally and is **not uploaded to GitHub**.  
If the database file does not exist, the application automatically creates it on startup, allowing the project to work seamlessly on different computers.



## Security Design and Decisions

Several security-related design decisions were made:

- Passwords are **never displayed directly** in the main table.
- Passwords are encrypted using **AES** before being stored.
- Decryption happens only when the user explicitly requests to see a password.
- The database remains local to avoid exposing sensitive data online.

For simplicity and learning purposes, the encryption key is hardcoded. In a real-world application, this key would be derived from a master password using a secure key derivation function such as PBKDF2.



## Design Choices and Tradeoffs

- **WinForms vs WPF**: WinForms was chosen because it is simpler and more approachable for learning desktop application development.
- **SQLite vs Online Database**: SQLite was selected to keep the application offline and easy to deploy without requiring a server.
- **Encrypted Storage vs Hashing**: Encryption was chosen instead of hashing because passwords need to be retrievable, unlike login passwords.
- **Automatic Database Creation**: This was implemented to ensure the application works immediately on any computer without manual setup.

These decisions prioritize simplicity, learning value, and usability over production-level complexity.



## Future Improvements

- Add a master password to derive the encryption key
- Implement a password strength indicator
- Add a password generator
- Improve UI design and usability
- Add clipboard copy with automatic clearing



## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:
- How to structure a complete application
- How to connect a C# application to a database
- How encryption and decryption work at a basic level
- How to separate responsibilities across different classes
- How to approach a larger project by breaking it into smaller steps
